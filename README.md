# Instagram-Scrapper
The program scrapes media from public Instagram Pages, please use this appropriately. 
It will result in a CSV file (openable in Excel/Numbers) which will seggregate the captions based on the respective photo.

Step 1: Install pip by going to terminal and entering:
        `python get-pip.py`
Step 2: Download `app.py` in a specific location on your computer and preferably under your "user" folder or desktop. 
( DO NOT CHANGE THE LOCATION, remember to download all files in the same location.)

Step 3: Download `InstagramScrappingData.py` (main file)

Step 4: To execute the file, open terminal and run : `python InstagramScrappingData.py <username to scrape>`

If user is private, you need an account that follows the user, then:

`python InstagramScrappingData.py <username to scrape> -u <approved follower username> -p <approved follower password>`

----------------
Executed files will be ready.
Do let me know if this works.
Cheers.
